# HEAVENSURF
## A reshade preset for Audiosurf 2 that is made for looks.

### What and why
#### This is a preset that includes 3 blooms, an alright cshade motion blur config, and some other goodies (rtgi, ao, filmgrain, uimask.)
#### The reason I used 3 blooms is actually pretty interesting. When I was first making this I noticed that some blooms effected the image in different ways.Blooming HDR, the last bloom on the list is my contrast bloom. I used it so the game felt less flat. qUINT bloom is my part 1 color bloom, I sandwiched this behind CShade bloom because it added more contrast and adds that bloom haze. CShade bloom is the final part to the equation. I added it as a second color bloom that add more color contrast that makes the game extremely vibrant.
#### I also added film grain and motion blur to give it that movie esque look.
#### The reason I made this preset was because I wanted to replicate that same feeling of wonder that I got when I originally saw the game, audiosurf. I didn't care if it tanked performance or made maps hardly readable, I just wanted it to feel like it use to. So after making this I think I've done it. It really gives that same amazing look I pictured as a kid. :)

### Guide
#### Video Guide: WIP
#### Installing reshade
##### WIP
#### After reshade installation
##### To setup the UIMask so you can see the UI during gameplay you can either drag in the ui mask that fits your resolution from the UIMask folder to `./reshade-shaders/Textures` and naming `UIMask.png` or creating a UIMask for your resolution and putting it in the textures folder.

### Tips
#### In menus, add a hotkey to disable effects. The effects are extremely bright and sometimes buggy in menus.
#### Make sure to setup the ui mask, check guide for tutorial for that.
